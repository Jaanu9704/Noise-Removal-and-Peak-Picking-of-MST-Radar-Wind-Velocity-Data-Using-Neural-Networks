# Noise Removal and Peak Picking of MST Radar Wind Velocity Data Using Neural Networks**
This project focuses on processing and analyzing wind velocity data from the Advanced Indian MST (Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere) Radar using deep learning techniques. The main goals are:

Noise Removal: Eliminate unwanted noise and irregularities in the radar signal data using neural networks.

Peak Picking: Accurately identify significant peaks in the cleaned data that correspond to meaningful wind velocity patterns.

🔍 Problem Statement
Radar wind profiles often contain noise due to atmospheric interference and hardware limitations. Identifying true peaks from such noisy data is crucial for accurate meteorological analysis. Traditional methods struggle with noisy environments. This project leverages the power of neural networks for effective denoising and reliable peak detection.
